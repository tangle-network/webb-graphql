<h1 id="usage"> Usage </h1>

<h2 id="prerequisites"> Prerequisites </h2>

- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

<h2 style="border-bottom:none"> Quick Start ‚ö° </h2>

- Please edit chain RPC info in `./configs/chains.prod.toml`. Please make sure you're using the correct RPC info for each chain.
- Please make sure you have correct contract address for vAnchor and FungibleTokenContracts in `./networks/live.json` for each of those chains.

```bash
yarn install
yarn redeploy-all-orbit
```

Graph explorer URL for all chains will be printed on your console. You can use those URL's to explore the graph.

<h2 id="contribute"> Development </h2>

1. To start develop this project, run the Orbit first by following the [instruction](https://github.com/webb-tools/orbit#-quick-start--) in Orbit repo.

2. Update these environment variables in `.env` file after copying from `.env.example` file.

```bash
export ATHENA_CHAIN_ID=5002
export HERMES_CHAIN_ID=5001
export DEMETER_CHAIN_ID=5003
export ATHENA_CHAIN_PORT=5002
export HERMES_CHAIN_PORT=5001
export DEMETER_CHAIN_PORT=5003
```

3. Still on Orbit repo, change directory to `deploy` and run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

4. Make a new deployment by the following command.

```bash
yarn deploy --deployWeth --allowWrappingNativeToken
```

5. Run the deposit script to generate some transactions for testing.

```bash
yarn deposit --contractAddress <DEPLOYED_ANCHOR_ADDRESS>
```

6. Go back to this repo and make sure you have correct chain RPC info in `./configs/chains.toml` and correct contract address for vAnchor and FungibleTokenContracts in `./networks/local.json` for each of those chains.

7. Run the following command to start the graph node.

```bash
yarn redeploy-all-local
```

<h2 id="useful-commands"> Useful Commands </h2>

- Sometimes, when restart the graph node, you might need to clear the graph node data. You can do so by running the following command.

```bash
yarn clean
```

- To stop the graph node, run the following command.

```bash
docker compose -f <DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE> down -v
```

- Follow the docker compose logs after starting the graph node.

```bash
docker compose -f <DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE> logs -f
```
